AI-Powered Enhanced EHR Imaging & Documentation System
===========================================================

Project Overview
----------------
This project enhances traditional Electronic Health Records (EHR) by integrating Generative AI for automated medical imaging analysis and clinical documentation. The system improves clarity and interpretability of medical images (X-rays, MRI, CT scans), reduces manual work for clinicians through auto-generated structured notes, and provides ICD-10 codes using intelligent mapping.

The objective is to streamline hospital workflows, reduce documentation burden, and support faster clinical decision-making by integrating imaging data, patient demographics, lab reports, and AI-driven insights into one unified platform.
